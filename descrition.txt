This is just a file for the description of the whole program
What I am basically doing is that

- first set basic configuration of the Modbus(Port, Buadrate, bytsize, parity, stopbite, and all the parameters that needed, like slave_id)
- then using the proper command should establish a connection, if it's connect try to read some data from the holding registers to make sure secure connection
